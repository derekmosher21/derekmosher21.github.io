        <h3> <a id="mystory">My Story </a></h3>
            <p> Hello! My name is Derek Mosher. I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio.
                I attended college at Miami University, and graduated in 2018 with a 
                major in Marketing and a minor in Supply Chain Management. After graduation,
                I went to work for ALDI Inc. as a District Manager. After completing a 50 
                week training program, I was assigned a district of stores in the tri state area 
                (OH, KY, WV). In this role I was responsible for a number of different items:
                the hiring process, P&L management, financial KPIs, Facility and maintenance
                issues, general image management, and more. After about two years with the
                company, I realized I was not fully satisfied with my work. I finally made 
                the decision to leave and pursue a career as a software developer. My goal is 
                to utilize my logical thinking and problem solving skills to become a successful 
                software developer.

            <p> Health is my main passion: I enjoy cooking and trying new foods, exercising in 
                many different fashions, and getting lots of sleep! I also love reading (my goal:
                one book per week). My recent interest in tech not only involves software development,
                but also building desktop computers and toying with Raspberry Pi microcomputers.
