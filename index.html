        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Derek Mosher. I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio.
          I attended college at Miami University, and graduated in 2018 with a
          major in Marketing and a minor in Supply Chain Management. After
          graduation, I went to work for ALDI Inc. as a District Manager. After
          completing a 50 week training program, I was assigned a district of
          stores in the tri state area (OH, KY, WV). In this role I was
          responsible for a number of different items: the hiring process, P&L
          management, financial KPIs, Facility and maintenance issues, project
          management, and more. After about two years with the company, I
          realized I was not fully satisfied with my work. I finally made the
          decision to leave and pursue a career as a software developer. My goal
          is to utilize my logical thinking and problem solving skills to become
          a successful software developer.
